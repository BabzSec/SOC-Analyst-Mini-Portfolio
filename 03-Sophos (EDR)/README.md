# 🛡️ Sophos EDR Lab

Hands-on exploration of **Sophos Intercept X with EDR**, showcasing endpoint detection, response, and investigation workflows.

---

## 📌 Overview
This folder documents how I set up and tested **Sophos Endpoint Detection & Response** as part of my SOC Analyst mini-portfolio.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in deploying, monitoring, and responding to endpoint threats.

## 🚀 Lab Steps (Summary)
1. **Create Sophos Central Trial** – Register for a free trial of *Intercept X with EDR*.  
2. **Deploy Agent** – Download and install the Windows endpoint agent.  
3. **Validate Connection** – Confirm the VM appears in Sophos Central.  
4. **Generate Events** – Run safe tests (e.g., EICAR, suspicious PowerShell) to trigger alerts.  
5. **Investigate & Respond** – Use the Sophos console to review and remediate detections.

> 💡 Tip: Keep a dedicated test VM isolated from production to safely trigger alerts.
