# üõ°Ô∏è Sophos Intercept X with EDR ‚Äì Setup Guide

This document explains how I deployed and tested **Sophos Intercept X with EDR** in my lab environment as part of my SOC Analyst mini-portfolio.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Sophos Central Trial
- Go to [Sophos Central Free Trials](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-trials).
- Select **Intercept X with EDR** and register for a free trial.
- Verify your email and sign in to the **Sophos Central** console.

> üí° Use a lab-dedicated email address for trials.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare a Test Endpoint
- Use an isolated Windows 10/11 VM.
- Ensure it has internet access and create a snapshot before testing.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Download & Install the Agent
- From Sophos Central, navigate to **Protect Devices** ‚Üí download the Windows installer.
- Run the installer on your VM and complete the setup.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Device Registration
- Confirm the endpoint appears under **Devices** in Sophos Central.
- Ensure the status shows as **Protected**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Test Events
- Use the [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/) to simulate malware detection.
- Run harmless PowerShell commands to trigger behavior detection.
- Observe alerts and detections in Sophos Central.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only run safe, lab-approved tests in an isolated VM.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Investigate & Respond
- Open an alert and review details such as process tree and recommended actions.
- Test remediation options (e.g., isolate endpoint, clean up files).

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Wrap Up
- Confirm all alerts are resolved after testing.
- Save notes about each step and detection for your portfolio.
