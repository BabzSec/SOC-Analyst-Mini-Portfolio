### 💡 Tips for All Alerts
- Exclude known safe accounts or service accounts to reduce false positives.  
- Use **Splunk lookup tables** for whitelisting trusted IPs or users.  
- Adjust thresholds and time windows based on **environment size** and **risk tolerance**.  
- For lab demonstrations, keep time ranges and thresholds short to generate visible results quickly.  
- Use **real-time alerts** for single-event detections and **scheduled alerts** for cumulative events like brute-force attacks.
